# POS (point-­of-­sale)
A simple POS application for a coffee shop like Starbucks. There should
be a page for the selection of base drinks and their associated modifiers. A page for the
confirmation of purchase is also required showing the cost based on drink type and chosen
modifiers.

Examples of base drinks can be drip coffee, lattes, smoothies, etc. Each type of base drink has
the potential of being composed of several components. For example, drip coffee is only made of
coffee, while lattes are composed of espresso and steamed milk. Each drink can have modifiers
applied to them. For example, coffee can be modified by sugar or milk, while lattes can have
chocolate syrup or whipped cream added.
